                Almost all of our save the dates, invitations, and thank-you notes are being delivered digitally with a
                goal towards minimizing the usage of paper. These small choices have helped us enjoy a more eco-friendly
                wedding.

                making this awesome website.)

                Shreya has recently embraced a vegan lifestyle since she believes that the dairy industry does
                unimaginable physical and psychological harm to dairy animals. We have tried our best to minimize the
                use of dairy products in the wedding dinner spread.
