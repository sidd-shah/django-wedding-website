                    In Sid, I first found my best friend, my human diary and then the love of my life and my other half.
                    He is my pillow, pillar and punching bag, all rolled into one. We have known each other for over
                    eight years now, dated for five, and been engaged for two. From being a bunch of teenagers sharing
                    mindless jokes and laughter and secrets to being two people deeply in love sharing dreams and hopes
                    and thoughts and plans about their life together, I have hopped on the most beautiful adventure of
                    my life with him. I cannot wait to commit to a lifetime of laughter, surprises, adventures, bad
                    dance moves and off-key singing, disagreements, holding on and never letting go with my best friend
                    and the most annoying, loving, goofy, perfect person I know.

                <p>
                    The first time I met Shreya in 2009, I felt a spark and I knew that she is going to be the one I
                    want to spend the rest of my life with. And I am so fortunate that everything worked out perfectly.
                    She is like this ideal beauty with brains, who almost always knows the right thing to do and is
                    always trying to raise the bar for the right thing too. Over the last 8 years of togetherness, we
                    have gone through this rollercoaster ride and seen each other at our best and worst and believe me,
                    every moment, my love for her has simply grown. From being best friends to girlfriend, classmates to
                    colleagues, girlfriend to fiancee, I have cherished every moment spent with her! Now, I canâ€™t wait
                    for the transition from fiancee to wifey and hop on to the beautiful adventure that awaits us!
