    <p>
        It is your presence, rather than presents, that we are looking forward to most. We have been fortunate to
        benefit in love and life. The greatest gift we can receive are your continued friendship and your presence at
        the wedding. However, if you are considering a gift, we would be honored by a donation to one of the causes in
        lieu of a traditional gift as both these causes are important to us and it would mean very much to us to be able
        to share and make a difference on our big day. We thank you for your generosity.
