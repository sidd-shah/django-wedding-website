                    It is your presence, rather than presents, that we are looking forward to most. We have been
                    fortunate to
                    benefit in love and life. The greatest gift we can receive are your continued friendship and your
                    presence at
                    the wedding. However, if you are considering a gift, we would be honored by a donation to one of the
                    causes in
                    lieu of a traditional gift as both these causes are important to us and it would mean very much to
                    us to be able
                    to share and make a difference on our big day. We thank you for your generosity.

                    <a href="http://www.sparkmicrogrants.org/">Spark MicroGrants</a> is a small NGO pioneering a new
                    method of community development.
                    Spark supports rural poor communities to design, implement and manage their own social impact
                    projects.
                    They provide micro-grants of between $2,000-$10,000 to enable project implementation, such as of a
                    school, electricity line or farm.

                    To date Spark has partnered with over 100 communities in Rwanda, Uganda, and Burundi who have
                    developed local project plans and are in the process of implementing them.
